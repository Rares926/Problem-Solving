## Problem-Solving

* Project 1 -> Implement two Uninformed Search algorithms -> Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search
* Project 2 -> Implement one Informed Search algorithm -> Greedy Best-First Search
* Project 3 -> Implement one Local Search algorithm -> Random Restart Hill Climbing
* Project 4 -> Implement one Adversarial Search algorithm -> Minimax
